In this Diabetes Database Patient Prediction Project, I dived into the world of data analysis and Python to work on the Diabetes Database. The aim was to analyze a Diabetes Patient dataset, uncover patterns, and visualize data to draw compelling conclusions.

## Overview
Dataset Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Database

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy

## Project Highlights

### 1. Data Cleaning: 
   The dataset presented some challenges with zero values that indicated null data. We took the initiative to clean the dataset by filling these null values with mean 
   and median values, ensuring the quality of our analysis.

### 2. Statistical Analysis: 
   We delved deep into the dataset to uncover patterns and correlations. This involved a rigorous statistical analysis, helping us better understand the dynamics of the data.

### 3. Data Visualization: 
   To make our findings more accessible and engaging, we created interactive charts and graphs. These visualizations not only highlighted trends but also made it easier to draw 
   compelling conclusions from the data.

## Key Insights: 

### In the course of this project, we unearthed some fascinating insights:

  An increase in Glucose levels significantly increases the likelihood of diabetes. Notably, when Glucose exceeds 170, the chances of diabetes are substantially higher, regardless of 
  age.

  We found that Glucose, BMI, Age, and Pregnancies are strongly correlated with the outcome, suggesting that higher glucose levels may be a significant contributor to the presence of 
  diabetes.

## Data Source:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle
